# Weather Script

Based on python, this script fetches the weather data of a given City and writes it to a file for later usage. 
This script will fetch new data every 5 Minutes. If it fails to fetch due to a connection error, it won't change the files.

To execute it, run py Weather.py in a terminal while being in the same directory as Weather.py. The .exe will not properly work for now.

# IMPORTANT
- You will need your own API key (https://openweathermap.org/api) and set it in your environment variables.
- I did not test to see if this works on linux. I suggest utilizing this only on windows for now. 
- This script can only be run directly in a terminal, still figuring out the .exe console pain.
